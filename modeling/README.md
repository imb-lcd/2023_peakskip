Run `simulation_1allele.m` and `simulation_2allele.m` to simulate p53 and Mdm2 dynamics

The difference between 1- and 2-allele simulation is at line 22: 1-allele simulation has a 10-fold stronger mRNA degradation than 2-allele simulation (i.e., gamma2=10 in `simulation_1allele.m` and gamma2=1 in `simulation_2allele.m`).
